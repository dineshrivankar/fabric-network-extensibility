### Installation Guide
Kindly install all the [Prerequisites](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/prereqs.html) mentioned on the official documentation. Make sure we have all the Docker Images downloaded locally.
We will be using JQ for Filtering JSON data.
```bash
       apt-get install jq
```
For exploration, we will take 4 VM with below specification.

|Organisation | VM Specification|
|-------------|-----------------|
|Swarm Master | 8GB, 2 vCPU     |
|Org1         | 8GB, 2 vCPU     |
|Org1         | 8GB, 2 vCPU     |
|Orderer      | 16GB, 4 vCPU    |
